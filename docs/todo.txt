    The second problem is that you need to use imap_tools.MailBox.
    Looking at the documentation and source at the repo it appears that the relevant classes to use are:

        MailBox - for a normal encrypted connection. This is what most email servers use these days, aka IMAPS (imap with SSL/TLS)
        MailBoxTls - For a STARTTLS connection: this creates a plaintext connection then upgrades
        it later by using a STARTTLS command in the protocol. The internet has mostly gone to the "always encrypted"
        rather than "upgrade" paradigm, so this is not the class to use.
        MailBoxUnencrypted - Standard IMAP without SSL/TLS. You should not use this on the public internet.

    The naming is a bit confusing. MailBox corresponds to imaplib.IMAP4_SSL;
    MailBoxTls corresponds to imaplib.IMAP4, then using startls() on the resulting connection;
    and MailboxUnencrypted corresponds to imaplib.IMAP4 with no security applied.
    I imagine it's this way so the most common one (Mailbox) is a safe default.
